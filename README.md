# **OverReact**

OverReact is an Airline Reservation System through which users can reserve and pay for flights in order to travel to various countries and cities.

# Motivation
The purpose of this project is to learn how to work on a large-scale MERN project and meet specific Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.

# **Build Status**
This basically explains the current build status of the project. If there is a bug /error which needs addressing. This is done so for two different reasons The user understands that this is an issue and does not spend more time figuring if it was a mistake on their part.A developer who is familiar with the issue can suggest some solutions directly without going through the whole code.

# **Code Style**
This lets the users know that you have used a particular code style and helps them when contributing to your project so that the whole project code style stays the same. Some common code styles: standard, xo, etc.

# **Screenshots**
As the saying goes, a picture is equal to a thousand words. Most people will be interested if there is a visual representation of what the project is about. It helps them understand better. A visual representation can be snapshots of the project or a video of the functioning of the project.

# **Tech/Frameworks used**
## MERN Stack was used to creat this project.
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

### MongoDB - document database
### Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
### React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
### Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server

# **Features**
This is where you write what all extra features have been done in your project. Basically this is where you try to make your project stand out from the rest.

# **Code Examples**
This is where you try to compress your project and make the reader understand what it does as simply as possible. This should help the reader understand if your code solves their issue.

# **Installation**
If your project needs installation of certain software or configurations to the system. Do mention it in this section as it helps a lot for the reader to use your project. The steps mentioned should be precise and explanatory.  If possible, you can add links that can help them better understand how to configure/install the necessary files or softwares.

# **API reference**
If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented.

# **Tests**
This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples
